	Yamagi Quake II is an enhanced client for id Software's Quake II. The main focus
	 is an unchanged single player experience like back in 1997, thus the gameplay 
	and the graphics are unaltered. Over 1000 bugs were fixed and an extensive code 
	audit done, making Yamagi Quake II one of the most solid Quake II 
	implementations available. Other than most ports Yamagi Quake II is full 64 bit 
	clean, so it works perfectly on modern 64 bit processors and operating systems. 
	Yamagi Quake II is supported on FreeBSD, Linux, Mac OS X, OpenBSD and Windows 
	(XP or higher). Porting to other (POSIX compliant) systems should be easy.
