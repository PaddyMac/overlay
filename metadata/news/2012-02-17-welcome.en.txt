Welcome to my overlay. The content of this overlay is experimental in nature.
This overlay is intended to be a sort of staging ground for new and experimental
ebuilds. When they are tested and found to be stable and well-writen enough, 
they will be submitted to the flora overlay. Please email me directly with any 
feedback, as it is welcome and appreciated. It requires a community effort to 
ensure that high quality software is available for easy installation on Gentoo 
and Funtoo systems.
