	bbfreeze creates stand-alone executables from python scripts. It's similar in purpose to the well known py2exe for windows, py2app for OS X, PyInstaller and
	cx_Freeze (in fact ancient versions were based on cx_Freeze. And it uses the modulegraph package, which is also used by py2app).

	It has the following features:

	easy installation
	bbfreeze can be installed with setuptools' easy_install command.

	zip/egg file import tracking
	bbfreeze tracks imports from zip files and includes whole egg files if some module is used from an eggfile. Packages using setuputils' pkg_resources
	module will now work (new in 0.95.0)

	binary dependency tracking
	bbfreeze will track binary dependencies and will include DLLs and shared libraries needed by a frozen program.

	multiple script freezing
	bbfreeze can freeze multiple scripts at once.

	python interpreter included
	bbfreeze will create an extra executable named 'py', which might be used like the python executable itself.

	automatic pathname rewriting
	pathnames in tracebacks are replaced with relative pathnames (i.e. if you import package foo.bar from /home/jdoe/pylib/ tracebacks generated from
	functions in foo.bar will not show your local path /home/jdoe/pylib/foo/bar.py. They will instead show foo/bar.py)

	distutils command 'bdist_bbfreeze'
	A new distutils/setuptools command bdist_bbfreeze integrates bbfreeze into your setup.py.

	bbfreeze works on windows and UNIX-like operating systems. bbfreeze has been tested with python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 bbfreeze will not work with python 3
	or higher.
