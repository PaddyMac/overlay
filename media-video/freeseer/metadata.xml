        Freeseer is a tool for capturing or streaming video.
	It enables you to capture great presentations, demos, training material,
	and other videos. It handles desktop screen-casting with ease.
	Freeseer is one of a few such tools that can also record vga output
	or video from external sources such as firewire, usb, s-video, or rca.
	It is particularly good at handling very large conferences with hundreds
	of talks and speakers using varied hardware and operating systems.
	Freeseer itself can run on commodity hardware such as a laptop or desktop.
