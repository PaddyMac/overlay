	Quake2World is a Free, standalone first person shooter video game. Our goal is 
	to bring the fun and excitement of straightforward old-school death-match 
	gaming to a more contemporary platform, and perhaps to a new generation of 
	gamers. Quake2World is multiplayer-only. There is no single-player or offline 
	gameplay mode. If you have no Internet and no friends, Quake2World might not 
	be for you.
